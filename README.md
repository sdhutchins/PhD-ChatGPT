How to use ChatGPT to help you in your scientific research.

## Helpful Prompts


## Cognitive Preservation Best Practices

Ensure you are not overrelying on llms or chat bots.

- **Draft first, then refine with AI**  
  Write a rough version yourself—ask AI to critique or tighten it.

- **Interrogate the output**  
  Ask "why?" and "what's missing?" rather than just accepting completions.

- **Use retrieval, not substitution**  
  Ask for sources or guiding questions—don't let it supply all the answers.

- **Request outlines over full drafts**  
  Keeps structure support while forcing you to flesh out ideas.

- **Rotate task types**  
  Alternate between generation (writing, coding) and evaluation (reviewing, editing).

- **Use critical prompts**  
  e.g., “Challenge this argument,” “What assumptions are being made?”

- **Limit AI autocomplete for language-heavy tasks**  
  E.g., try writing in French, then ask for corrections—not full rewrites.

- **Reflect after use**  
  Summarize what the AI added to your understanding and what you’d do differently.

- **Maintain spaced practice**  
  Revisit and revise past outputs manually to reinforce learning.

- **Use AI as a mirror**  
  Ask it to paraphrase your logic—if it misinterprets, clarify your thinking.
